# PyBank

* In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your          company. You are given a set of financial data and your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the          records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

# PyPoll

* In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. You will     be give a set of poll. The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Your task    is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast
  * A complete list of candidates who received votes
  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
  * The total number of votes each candidate won
  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

# PyBoss

In this challenge, you get to be the _boss_. You oversee hundreds of employees across the country developing Tuna 2.0, a world-changing snack food based on canned tuna fish. Alas, being the boss isn't all fun, games, and self-adulation. The company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for you, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.

Your task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format. 

# PyParagraph

In this challenge, you get to play the role of chief linguist at a local learning academy. As chief linguist, you are responsible for assessing the complexity of various passages of writing, ranging from the sophomoric Twilight novel to the nauseatingly high-minded research article. Having read so many passages, you've since come up with a fairly simple set of metrics for assessing complexity.

Your task is to create a Python script to automate the analysis of any such passage using these metrics. Your script will need to do the following:

* Import a text file filled with a paragraph of your choosing.

* Assess the passage for each of the following:
  * Approximate word count
  * Approximate sentence count
  * Approximate letter count (per word)
  * Average sentence length (in words)
